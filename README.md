#  About MiFeeD

MiFeeD is a tool for mining evolutionary dependencies in highly-configurable software systems.

Details about the tool and how to run it can be found in the [tools folder](./tools).

Moreover, we provide the results of an empirical study about evolutionary feature dependencies in the [results folder](./results).
Detials about this study can be found in the corresponding paper ["Evolutionary Feature Dependencies: Analyzing Feature Co-Changes in C Systems"](https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/314500586/Schulze2023FeatureCoChanges.pdf), published at [SCAM 2023](https://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/).
